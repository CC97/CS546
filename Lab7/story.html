        <h1>A time when I helped a friend</h1>
        <main>
            <p>The experience I am going to tell you is that I helped my best friend make up his mind to participate in a competition. Although we have never gone to the same school or lived in the same community, we have known each other from a very early age. This is because our mothers are close friends and they often visit each other, which gives us plenty of opportunities to get familiar.</p>
            <p>It was about a year ago, when he was hesitating about whether to take the Mathematical Olympic Games of our province. If he took it and won, the benefits would be enormous. However, if he lost, he would waste a huge amount of time, which might affect his performance on other subjects.</p>
            <p>I encouraged him to sign up for this competition. I said, “I believe in you. You have the potential to defeat all the others. Even if you did not make it, at least you have tried. This article is from Laokaoya website. Otherwise, you will definitely regret it in the future”. He followed my advice and registered for this competition. After two months’ preparation, he won.</p>
            <p>I was proud of this experience. To some extent, it changed my friend’s life. The championship brought him a great advantage when he applied for the university and helped him get into his dream school, which was nearly impossible if he had not taken part.</p>
